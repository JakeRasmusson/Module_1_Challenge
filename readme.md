# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor an already existing website to make it more accesible.  This included adding alt tags to all images, and adding semantic HTML elements where needed to make the Codebase more readable.  I learned many different HTML semantic tags, while also learning how to simplify many seperate IDs into common classes.  Thus simplfying the CSS.
